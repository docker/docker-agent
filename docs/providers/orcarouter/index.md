_Use OrcaRouter models with Docker Agent._

## Overview

[OrcaRouter](https://www.orcarouter.ai) provides access to models from many providers through an OpenAI-compatible API. Docker Agent includes built-in support for OrcaRouter as an alias provider. It also runs gateway-level, zero-trust security for AI agents on the same endpoint — screening every prompt/response and governing every tool call on a default-deny basis, with no application code changes.

## Setup

1. Get an API key from [OrcaRouter](https://www.orcarouter.ai)
2. Set the environment variable:

   ```bash
   export ORCAROUTER_API_KEY=your-api-key
   ```

## Usage

### Inline Syntax

The simplest way to use OrcaRouter:

```yaml
agents:
  root:
    model: orcarouter/orcarouter/auto
    description: Assistant using OrcaRouter
    instruction: You are a helpful assistant.
```

`orcarouter/auto` is OrcaRouter's adaptive router, which routes each request to the best available model for the task. You can also reference any model served by the gateway with its upstream provider prefix, such as `orcarouter/anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5` or `orcarouter/deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro`. Docker Agent splits only the first slash, so the full upstream model ID is preserved.

### Named Model

For more control over parameters:

```yaml
models:
  orca_router:
    provider: orcarouter
    model: orcarouter/auto
    temperature: 0.7
    max_tokens: 8192

agents:
  root:
    model: orca_router
    description: Assistant using OrcaRouter
    instruction: You are a helpful assistant.
```

## Pricing and Model Metadata

Docker Agent fetches OrcaRouter model metadata from [models.dev](https://models.dev/), including pricing per 1M input/output tokens, cache pricing when available, context limits, output limits, and modalities. This powers cost tracking and the model picker in the same way as other first-class providers.

If models.dev is unavailable, Docker Agent falls back to its embedded catalog snapshot.

## How It Works

OrcaRouter is implemented as a built-in alias in Docker Agent:

- **API Type:** OpenAI-compatible (`openai`)
- **Base URL:** `https://api.orcarouter.ai/v1`
- **Token Variable:** `ORCAROUTER_API_KEY`

## Example: Code Assistant

```yaml
agents:
  coder:
    model: orcarouter/orcarouter/auto
    description: Code assistant using OrcaRouter
    instruction: |
      You are an expert programmer.
      Write clean, maintainable code.
      Explain trade-offs when helpful.
    toolsets:
      - type: filesystem
      - type: shell
      - type: think
```
