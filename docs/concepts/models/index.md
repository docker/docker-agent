_Models are the AI brains behind your agents. Docker Agent supports multiple providers and flexible configuration._

## Inline vs. Named Models

There are two ways to assign a model to an agent:

### Inline (Quick)

Use the `provider/model` shorthand directly in the agent definition:

```yaml
agents:
  root:
    model: openai/gpt-5
    instruction: You are a helpful assistant.
```

### Named (Full Control)

Define models in a `models` section and reference them by name:

```yaml
models:
  claude:
    provider: anthropic
    model: claude-sonnet-4-5
    max_tokens: 64000
    temperature: 0.7

agents:
  root:
    model: claude
    instruction: You are a helpful assistant.
```

Named models let you configure temperature, token limits, thinking budgets, and other parameters. They're also reusable across multiple agents.

## First Available Models

A named model can also select the first usable model from a priority list. This
is useful for shared configs that should prefer paid cloud models when their API
keys are present, but still work with a local fallback:

```yaml
models:
  smart:
    first_available:
      - anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5
      - openai/gpt-5
      - dmr/ai/qwen3

agents:
  root:
    model: smart
    instruction: You are a helpful assistant.
```

At load time, Docker Agent selects the first candidate whose credentials are
configured. You only need credentials for one candidate. See
[Model Configuration](../../configuration/models/index.md#first-available-models)
for details.

## Supported Providers

See [Model Providers](../../providers/overview/index.md) for provider comparisons and the complete [provider keys and credentials table](../../providers/overview/index.md#provider-credentials). Each provider's page covers its models and setup.

## Model Properties

| Property            | Type       | Description                                       |
| ------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `provider`          | string     | Provider identifier (required)                    |
| `model`             | string     | Model name (required)                             |
| `description`       | string     | Human-readable summary of the model's purpose     |
| `temperature`       | float      | Randomness: 0.0 (deterministic) to 1.0 (creative) |
| `max_tokens`        | int        | Maximum response length                           |
| `top_p`             | float      | Nucleus sampling: 0.0 to 1.0                      |
| `frequency_penalty` | float      | Reduce repetition: 0.0 to 2.0                     |
| `presence_penalty`  | float      | Encourage topic diversity: 0.0 to 2.0             |
| `base_url`          | string     | Custom API endpoint                               |
| `thinking_budget`   | string/int | Reasoning effort configuration                    |
| `task_budget`       | int/object | Total token budget for an agentic task (Anthropic; honored by Opus 4.7 today) |
| `provider_opts`     | object     | Provider-specific options                         |

## Reasoning / Thinking Budget

Control how much the model "thinks" before responding:

| Provider   | Format     | Values                                                              | Default                          |
| ---------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| OpenAI     | string     | `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max`                  | `medium` (always-reasoning models only) |
| Anthropic  | int or str | 1024–32768 tokens, or `adaptive`, `adaptive/<effort>`, effort level | off                              |
| Gemini 2.5 | int        | 0 (off), -1 (dynamic), or token count                               | -1 (dynamic)                     |
| Gemini 3   | string     | `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`                                  | varies                           |
| All        | string/int | `none` or `0` clears Docker Agent's local config                    | —                                |

`none` and `0` are not universal API-level disable switches. On genuine OpenAI
gpt-5.6+ endpoints (Sol/Terra/Luna), `none` is a real `reasoning_effort` value
that Docker Agent sends as-is and the model does not reason. On older OpenAI
models, `none`/`0` only clear the local `thinking_budget` — omitting the field
has the same effect — and the model falls back to the API's own default effort
(still reasoning internally for always-reasoning models like the o-series).
Providers with a true optional-thinking switch (Gemini 2.5, Claude, local
models) are fully disabled by `none`/`0`. See the
[Thinking / Reasoning guide](../../guides/thinking/index.md#disabling-thinking)
for the full per-provider breakdown.

```yaml
models:
  deep-thinker:
    provider: anthropic
    model: claude-sonnet-4-5
    thinking_budget: 16384

  fast-responder:
    provider: openai
    model: gpt-5.6
    thinking_budget: none # real API-level disable on gpt-5.6+
```

> [!NOTE]
> **Multi-provider teams**
>
> Different agents can use different providers in the same config. See [Multi-Agent](../multi-agent/index.md) for patterns.

## Alloy Models

"Alloy models" let you use more than one model in the same conversation — Docker Agent alternates between them to leverage the strengths of each:

```yaml
agents:
  root:
    model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5,openai/gpt-5
    instruction: You are a helpful assistant.
```
